Ok, what is this:

This was originally a fork from

https://github.com/LeonardoRM/owncloud-roundcube

However, now this fork just concentrates to embed an external
Roundcube installation into a Nextcloud installation, there is no intent whatseover to keep
compatibility with Owncloud.

Knowning that there is nowaday a dedicated native Nextcloud email app this might be
questionable. OTOH, Roundcube is **really** a **very** **mature** email web app. So.

Currently the focus is on Roundcube version v1.6 and Nextcloud version
25 and on pushing this fork into the Nextcloud app-store.

Status is: hey, it works for me! Surprise!

Please feel free to submit issues, discussions, pull-request (<- most welcome, please do!).

NO guarantees. However, I am using this beast in a production way as
part of a groupware managing a quite active layman orchestra in
Germany. This means: I will at least see that it works for me. Grin.
